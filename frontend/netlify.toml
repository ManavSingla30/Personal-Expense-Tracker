## 📁 Your Project Structure Should Look Like:
```
frontend/
├── public/
│   ├── _redirects          ← Add this file
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx
│   └── ...
├── package.json
├── netlify.toml            ← Or add this file
└── vite.config.js

🚀 Redeploy on Netlify
After adding the _redirects file:
Method 1: Git Push (Recommended)
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Add redirects for SPA routing"
git push
Netlify will auto-deploy.
Method 2: Manual Redeploy

Go to Netlify dashboard
Your site → Deploys
Click "Trigger deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"


🔍 Why This Happens
React Router uses client-side routing. When you:

Click links in your app → ✅ Works (JavaScript handles routing)
Refresh page or enter URL directly → ❌ 404 (Server looks for actual file)

The _redirects file tells Netlify:

"For ANY route, serve index.html and let React Router handle it"


✅ Verify It's Working

Deploy with _redirects file
Visit: https://your-app.netlify.app/expense-list
Refresh the page
Should work now! ✨


🐛 Still Not Working?
Check Build Settings on Netlify:

Go to Site settings → Build & deploy
Verify:

Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist (for Vite) or build (for Create React App)



Check Your Routes:
Make sure your React Router is set up correctly:
javascript// App.jsx or main router file
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
        <Route path="/expense-list" element={<ExpenseList />} />
        <Route path="/add-expense" element={<AddExpense />} />
        <Route path="/edit-expense" element={<EditExpense />} />
        <Route path="/reports" element={<Reports />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

📝 Complete Checklist:

 Create public/_redirects with /* /index.html 200
 Commit and push to GitHub
 Wait for Netlify auto-deploy (or trigger manual deploy)
 Test: Visit your site URL + any route
 Test: Refresh the page on different routes
 All routes should work now! ✅
